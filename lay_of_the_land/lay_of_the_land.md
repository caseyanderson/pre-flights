## Languages

Programming languages are typically either General Purpose or Domain Specific:
* [General Purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language): suitable for development across a number of applications, does not privilege a particular kind functionality of application over others. For example: [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), or [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).
* [Domain Specific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language): intended to development in certain applications only. For example: [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [SuperCollider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider).


## Interpreted vs Compiled

* [Interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language): a programming language where commands are executed directly without compiling into a different format. Example: Python, Javascript, SuperCollider.
* [Compiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language): a programming language where commands are used to generate static machine code prior to execution. Example: [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), [Processing](https://processing.org/).


##  Visual Programming vs Writing Code

Visual Programming platforms abstract functions and other basic components of programming languages into widgets. The emphasis is on the rapid acquisition of skills and as such are very popular in educational contexts (and not used very much elsewhere). Examples: [NTK](http://www.netlabtoolkit.org/), [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max/), [PureData](http://puredata.info/), [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/about/), [Unity](https://unity3d.com/).

Frequently  these applications try to "make programming easier" by giving you "out of the box" or "plug and play" functionality. This is all well and fine until you have an idea or need that did not occur to the programmer developing Unity (for example), at which point the reliance on "it just works" technology completely breaks down. In other words, Visual Programming is fine for some things, but one will quickly encounter the limits therein as their ideas grow.


## MDP Recommends

* NTK for rapid interactive prototyping and acquisition of programming concepts
* Javascript/Python, HTML, CSS for web portfolios and sites
* Python for general purpose programming
* Arduino for prototyping digital electronics
* SuperCollider for computationally working with sound
